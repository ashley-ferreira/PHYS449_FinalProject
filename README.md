Development notes from Ashley:
- I've implimented the basic skeleton for all 4 CNNs mentioned in the paper, I will need to review aspects to make sure they are correct and see if the paper says what specific padding, stide, activation, and loss functions are used
- The paper implimented these in keras so I did so too but I can easily convert to pytorch and we should be able to easily use our pytorch tensors with a small conversion, we will discuss this
