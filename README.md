Development notes from Ashley:

In this Paper we tried to replicate the results from the above paper for their "C2" network and their old "C1" network using PyTorch and Keras. In the paper they had originally used Keras to run their neural networks. We decided to run the neural networks using PyTorch and Keras to compare the modules.

The main work we did for this project is located in the  'Notebooks' folder. It is what was used to train and test the models. They were ran using Google Collab using their computing resources.
